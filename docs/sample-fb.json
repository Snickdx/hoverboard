I don’t know about you, but I know many that spent hours trying to press those specific sequences of red, green, blue and yellow buttons in the correct order. But why play on your own? We’ve implemented a gRPC server that allows you to play Simon with other players over the internet!\n\nIn this workshop we will dive into the toolset and libraries to build your very own Simon Says client for this server. We will have a message description in Protocol Buffers format and some stub code in several languages ready for you to play with. The goal for this workshop is for you to have a working client that you can use to play (and beat!) other attendees of the workshop.",

He rushes into the room with a big shabang by shooting all background services and network requests that forgot to get away. \nHe should no longer be shy. He just shoots and dances on bones of your scheduled alarms, while you wonder why this particular task is no longer running.\nWith the new Doze mode, you require to adapt your app architecture to the new reality.\nOn this talk, we will learn how to survive Doze mode using Job Scheduler, Content Provider and stay in one piece.",

But what is the value, and how can one prevent IoT applications which just seem to be only more expensive and complicated than conventional solutions. Sascha will discuss the purpose and guide you through this complex topic showing inspiring solutions, tips from practice, and code samples in a variety of technologies from simple Bluetooth Eddystone Beacons to more sophisticated IoT platforms like Eclipse SmartHome.",
