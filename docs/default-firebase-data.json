In this lightning talk I would walk through my tech stack (React.js), parsing the CSV from Johns Hopkins and deployment.

    "description": "For several years now, that we’ve been trying to find new solutions on how we could develop a single project and run it on all platforms. We’ve been seeing all types of solutions: some are web-based, others require you to learn a new language, and others even may require that you pay a monthly fee to use. It also comes with the drawback that all your UI depends on the framework implementation. So, if there’s a native update you’ll need to wait until someone rewrites the widgets for you to update your app.\n\nKotlin multiplatform gives us a new solution. It focuses on sharing your business logic across all platforms, leaving the UI to be implemented natively. Since it’s Kotlin, you can take full advantage of its language features - concise, safe, etc. Moreover, if you’re coming from android you might already be familiarised with Kotlin and even if you’re an iOS developer you’ll see that it’s quite similar to Swift.\n\nJoin me on this triathlon and let’s go through Android, iOS, and Web in under 30 minutes.",

It gives you the power of requesting the exact data you need from a server in a single query and receive it in a JSON object; whereas in REST you have to make requests to multiple endpoints in gathering data.

Conversational AI is already impacting industries by creating “human-like” exchanges between end-users and software systems and presents a promising role in evolving how humans interact with computer systems in the future. However, given this uptrend of adopting Conversational AI, the world of Management Information Systems remains untouched by this phenomenon.
